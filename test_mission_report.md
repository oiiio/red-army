**Generated:** 2025-09-18 18:22:53

### üìã Mission Objective

To evaluate the security posture of the target SCADA system and assess the effectiveness of existing security monitoring and detection capabilities.  This included identifying potential attack vectors and determining whether these vectors could be successfully exploited to compromise the system, while also gauging the system's ability to detect and respond to such attacks.


### üìñ Execution Summary

1. **Reconnaissance:** The Infiltrator initiated network scanning and identified a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) at IP address 192.168.1.100. This PLC was determined to be a critical component of the SCADA system.
2. **Modbus Anomaly Injection:** The Saboteur executed a Modbus anomaly injection attack against the identified PLC, attempting to disrupt normal operations.
3. **Safety System Manipulation:** The Executioner attempted to directly manipulate safety systems, simulating a scenario where an attacker seeks to bypass safety mechanisms.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** The Chronicler observed anomaly alerts generated by the GridGuardian monitoring system, indicating successful detection of certain attack activities.
5. **Mission Conclusion:** The mission concluded with a partial compromise of the target SCADA system. While attack vectors were successfully executed, demonstrating vulnerabilities, the GridGuardian system effectively detected some of the malicious activity.


### ‚úÖ Outcome

**PARTIAL SUCCESS.** The red team successfully exploited vulnerabilities and demonstrated potential attack paths to compromise the SCADA system. However, the existing monitoring system partially mitigated the attack by detecting anomalous activity. This indicates both exploitable weaknesses and functioning defensive mechanisms.


### üîç Key Findings

* **Vulnerable PLC:** The PLC at 192.168.1.100 is susceptible to Modbus anomaly injection attacks. This highlights a potential entry point for malicious actors.
* **Safety System Bypass Potential:** The executioner's successful manipulation of safety systems demonstrates a critical vulnerability that could lead to significant operational disruptions or safety hazards.
* **Effective Anomaly Detection:** The GridGuardian system successfully detected anomalous Modbus traffic, demonstrating a functional monitoring capability.
* **Gaps in Monitoring Coverage:** While some attacks were detected, the success of the safety system manipulation suggests gaps in the monitoring coverage or detection logic.


### üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

* **Harden PLC Security:** Implement robust security measures for the PLC, including access control lists, firmware updates, and Modbus protocol security enhancements.
* **Enhance Safety System Protections:**  Review and strengthen the security controls around safety systems, including multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection, and regular security audits.
* **Improve Monitoring Coverage:** Expand the scope of the GridGuardian monitoring system to encompass all critical SCADA components and functions, including safety systems.  Investigate the specific reasons why the safety system manipulation was not detected.
* **Regular Red Team Assessments:** Conduct periodic red team assessments to proactively identify and address emerging vulnerabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of security controls.


### üìä Technical Summary

* **Attack Vectors:** Modbus anomaly injection, direct manipulation of safety systems.
* **Tools Employed:**  (Specific tool names redacted for security reasons - e.g., Metasploit,  custom Modbus manipulation scripts)
* **Target System:** SCADA system with PLC at 192.168.1.100.
* **Monitoring System:** GridGuardian.
* **System Responses:** GridGuardian generated alerts for anomalous Modbus traffic. No alerts were observed for safety system manipulation.
* **Exploited Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of input sanitization on safety system controls, insecure Modbus implementation on PLC.
